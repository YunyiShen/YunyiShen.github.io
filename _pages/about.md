I am a (statistics) PhD student (with [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/)) in the EECS department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). Previously I got two MSc degrees in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and a SM degree from MIT in Computer Science. I did my undergraduate degree in Biology/Physics at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). 

New sciences are driven by new measurements and new measurements need new statistics. My research focus on statistical methods and experimental planning for new measurement methods in biology and physics, ranging from perturbing gene networks, measuring fluid dynamics in cells, surveying animal populations to calibrating standard candles for cosmological distances. I also maintain a line of ecological research on large carnivores, currently focused on population ecology and economical values of apex predator species namely gray wolves (*Canis lupus*) and jaguars (*Panthera onca*) in various locations. 


## Current projects
- Interpolating between spectra and light curves of Type-Ia supernovae subtypes using diffusion models; 
- Pressure field estimation with uncertainty quantification in cell fluid dynamics using Gaussian processes and particle tracking velocimetry;
- Distributional timeseries analysis, regressions and factor models, [Schrodinger bridges](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7UqA6WjwTO) and inference of SDEs, corresponding sampling strategies and applications in computational biology and oceanography;
- Species and feature sampling problem with heterogeneity, multivariate (completely) random measures and [application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02154) in genetics and sequencing strategies;


## Some stuff I have worked in the past
- Identifying stellar flares from photometric data [using Hidden Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13145);
- [Spike-and-Slab LASSO](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume--1/issue--1/Estimating-Sparse-Direct-Effects-in-Multivariate-Regression-With-the-Spike/10.1214/24-BA1430.full) on multivariate regressions/chain graphs, its [frequentist properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04389) and [experimental design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-024-00621-1) for microbiome studies.




## More about me
I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time. I hold a technician class amateur radio license, bearing KD9TZJ call sign. I am also an [ACG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)) fan.
