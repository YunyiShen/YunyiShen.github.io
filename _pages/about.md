I am a PhD student in the EECS department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) affiliated with LIDS. I earned my MSc degrees in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2021. I did my undergraduate degree in Physical Biology at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). 

I am generally interested in statistics for biodiversity at different levels. For me as a statistician, I study Bayesian nonparametrics, variable and graphical selection, and scalable Bayesian computing. On the math side I am particularly interested in the so-called species sampling problem (some [classic](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/43/1-2/45/334874)) especially with heterogeneity. For me as an ecologist, I study population and community ecology especially for carnivores. I am also interested in time-series data from space telescopes (e.g. TESS, HST).  

Several recent statistics projects are:

- [Bayesian nonparametrics method](https://openreview.net/forum?id=euBgC9yLeyl) predicting of shared variants across cancer types/populations, Beta/Indian Buffet process and their multivariate extensions, multivariate random measures;
- Graphical selection of Gaussian chain graph models using [Bayesian LASSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08397)/[Spike-and-Slab LASSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07020) methods, their [theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04389), interpretations, corresponding [experimental design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01306), scalable inferences, as well as applications in ecology and genetics;

Recent (mostly collaborative) ecology projects are:

- Population and spatial expansion of gray wolves (*Canis lupus*) in Wisconsin; 

A recent fun astronomy project:

- Stellar flare detection using Gaussian process combined with HMMs. 


I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time. Partly due to my outdoor hobby I hold a technician class amateur radio license, my call sign is KD9TZJ. I am also an [ACG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)) fan.
