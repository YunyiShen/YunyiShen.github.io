I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I earned my MSc degrees in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2021. I did my undergraduate degree in Physical Biology at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). 

I am generally interested in statistical ecology. For me as a statistician, I study probablistic graphical models (PGMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). For me as an ecologist, I studied mainly population and community ecology. I also have some interest in statistical astronomy and worked on photometrical data analysis (flare detection in particular). Several past projects are carnivore community in the [Apostle Island National Lakeshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apostle+Islands/@47.0153533,-90.8540994,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52a8f887c4797d43:0x8009ed773211222d!8m2!3d47.0027301!4d-90.6908353) in Wisconsin using Markov random field models with imperfect observations, population reconstruction of an intensively managed deer population in Chicago, LASSO method in **C**onditional **A**uto **R**egression (CAR-LASSO) for ecological network reconstruction with environmental predictors and its experimental design. 


I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time, also a big fan of [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (which just came to an end in March 2021). Currently learning to play guitar (partially due to [K-On!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-On!) by [KyoAni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Animation), and partially due to the pandemic).
