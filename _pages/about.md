I am a MS student (as of 2020-06-26) in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I did my undergraduate degree in Physical Biology at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn).

I am interested in Bayesian network reconstruction from observations and their applications in the community ecology of mammals/plants/microbes. I studied carnivore community in the [Apostle Island National Lakeshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apostle+Islands/@47.0153533,-90.8540994,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52a8f887c4797d43:0x8009ed773211222d!8m2!3d47.0027301!4d-90.6908353) using auto-regressive models with [Tim Van Deelen](http://labs.russell.wisc.edu/vandeelen/) in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology and Probabilistic Graphic Models as well as its application on plant microbiome with [Claudia Sol&iacute;s-Lemus](https://crsl4.github.io/) in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery.

I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time, also a big fan of [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion).
