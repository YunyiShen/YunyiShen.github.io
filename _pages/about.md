I am a MS student (as of 2021-03-24) in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I did my undergraduate degree in Physical Biology at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). I will move to [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in Fall 2021. 

I am interested in Bayesian network reconstruction from (indirect) observations and their applications in the community ecology of mammals/plants/microbes. I studied carnivore community in the [Apostle Island National Lakeshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apostle+Islands/@47.0153533,-90.8540994,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52a8f887c4797d43:0x8009ed773211222d!8m2!3d47.0027301!4d-90.6908353) using Ising models with imperfect observations in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology and **C**onditional **A**uto **R**egressive **LASSO** model (CAR-LASSO) as well as its application in plant microbiome in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery.

I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time, also a big fan of [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) (which just came to an end in March 2021).
