I am a (final year) PhD candidate (with [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/)) in the EECS department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) and a junior investigator in [IAIFI](https://iaifi.org/). Previously I got two MSc degrees in Statistics and Ecology from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and a ScM degree from MIT in Computer Science. I did my undergraduate degree in Biology/Physics at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). I spent a summer in quantitative finance industry in 2025. 

I am primarily interested in machine learning for low signal-to-noise and data-scarce settings, where incorporating structure, designing data collection strategies, and carefully managing downstream risk are essential. My work is broadly motivated by scientific problems in biology and physics that naturally operate in this regime, ranging from perturbation experiments in gene regulatory networks and intracellular fluid dynamics to wildlife population surveys and the calibration of standard candles in the cosmic distance ladder.

**I'm currently on job market!** I am looking for postdoc, TT assistant professor, research scientist or quantitative researcher roles. Please feel free to email me if you want to chat!  


## Current projects
- Trajectory and SDE inference in computational biology using [multimarginal Schrödinger bridges](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VcwZ3gtYFY) and [least square in distribution space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16082); identifiability theory of stochastic dynamics; 
- [Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04991) of learning human preference from binary annotations, corresponding [experimental design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04354) and [robustness checks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=b9r1snfxIH&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICML.cc%2F2025%2FWorkshop%2FMoFA%2FAuthors%23your-submissions)8), with applications in Large Language Model alignment and evaluations;

## Some stuff I have worked in the past
- Species and feature sampling problem with heterogeneity, multivariate (completely) random measures and [application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02154) in genetics and sequencing strategies;
- Identifying stellar flares from photometric data [using Hidden Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13145);
