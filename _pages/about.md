I am a (statistics) PhD student (with [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/)) in the EECS department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I earned my MSc degrees in Statistics and Ecology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2021. I did my undergraduate degree in Biology/Physics at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). 

My research is mostly motivated by applications in ecology while focusing on structural learning, uncertainty quantification,  robustness and connection to scientific (e.g. ecological, physical) theories in modern, complex data structure and analysis procedures. On the statistics side I study Bayesian nonparametrics, variable and graphical selection, scalable Bayesian computing and applied machine learning. On the ecology side I study population and community ecology mostly for carnivores. I have some random interests including multimessenger astronomy, space telescopes (e.g. TESS, HST) and NLP for Chinese politics. Unfortunately I am not able to mentor UROP students at the moment.

## My research
Most recent statistics project:

- [Bayesian nonparametrics method](https://openreview.net/forum?id=euBgC9yLeyl) predicting of shared variants across cancer types/populations, species sampling problem with relaxations on exchangability, multivariate random measures;
- Graphical selection of Gaussian chain graph models using [Spike-and-Slab LASSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07020) and its [frequentist properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04389);

Most recent ecology project:

- Population and spatial expansion of gray wolves (*Canis lupus*) in Wisconsin and the Great Lake region, theory of *spatial induced* density dependent; 

A recent fun astronomy project:

- Stellar flare detection using Gaussian process combined with HMMs. 

## More about me
I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time. I hold a technician class amateur radio license, bearing KD9TZJ call sign. I am also an [ACG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)) fan.
