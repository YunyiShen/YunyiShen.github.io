I am a PhD student in the EECS department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) affiliated with LIDS. I earned my MSc degrees in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2021. I did my undergraduate degree in Physical Biology at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). 

I am generally interested in statistics of biology, ecology and astronomy. For me as a statistician, I study variable and graphical selection, Bayesian nonparametrics, exchangability and scalable Bayesian computing. For me as an ecologist, I study community ecology. I am also interested in (and worked on) time series data collected by space telescopes (e.g. TESS, HST).  

Several recent statistics projects are:

- Bayesian nonparametrics for the experimental design of rare variant association analysis, beta process and its extensions, multivariate random measures;
- Graphical selection of Gaussian chain graph models using Bayesian LASSO/Spike-and-Slab LASSO methods, their theories, interpretations, corresponding experimental design, as well as applications in ecology and genetics;

Several recent (mostly collaborative) ecology projects are:

- Population dynamics of WI wolves (*Canis lupus*); 
- Understanding carnivore community in the [Apostle Island National Lakeshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apostle+Islands/@47.0153533,-90.8540994,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52a8f887c4797d43:0x8009ed773211222d!8m2!3d47.0027301!4d-90.6908353) in Wisconsin using Markov random field models with imperfect observations;


A recent astronomy project:

- Stellar flare detection using Gaussian process combined with HMMs; 



I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time. Partly due to my outdoor hobby I hold a technician class amateur radio license, my call sign is KD9TZJ. I am also an [ACG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)) fan. Recently finally finished [Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) film and TV series of [JoJo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure).
