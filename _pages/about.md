I will move to the EECS department at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) this comming summer as a PhD student, but I am currently in a gap year at UW-Madison. I earned my MSc degrees in Statistics and Wildlife Ecology at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2021. I did my undergraduate degree in Physical Biology at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn). 

I am generally interested in statistics of non-human objects, namely ecology and astronomy. For me as a statistician, I study variable and graphical selection, Bayesian nonparametrics, exchangability and scalable Bayesian computing. For me as an ecologist, I study community ecology, mainly species coexistence (graphical model!) and neutral theory (exchangability!). I am also interested in time series analysis in astronomy and worked on photometrical data analysis (stellar flare detection in particular). Several recent projects are 

- Graphical selection of Gaussian chain graph models using Bayesian LASSO/Spike-and-Slab LASSO methods, their theory, interpretation and corresponding experimental design; 
- Stellar flare detection using Gaussian process combined with HMMs; 
- Understanding carnivore community in the [Apostle Island National Lakeshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apostle+Islands/@47.0153533,-90.8540994,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52a8f887c4797d43:0x8009ed773211222d!8m2!3d47.0027301!4d-90.6908353) in Wisconsin using Markov random field models with imperfect observations.



I am a wildlife photographer and angler in my spare time. Partly due to my outdoor hobby I hold a technician class amateur radio license, my call sign is KD9TZJ. I am also an [ACG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)) fan. Recently finally finished [Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) film and TV series of [JoJo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure).
